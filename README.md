![GeoGemma](https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png)

## Overview
GeoGemma is a **Google-funded research project** aimed at integrating Generative AI capabilities with **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**. Developed as part of the prestigious **Gemma Academic Reward**, it focuses on creating an AI-powered mapping system that enhances geospatial analysis through **GeoLLMs (Geospatial Large Language Models)**.

## Features
- **GenEE (Generative Earth Engine)**: A GenAI-powered interface for GEE.
- **Fine-tuned GeoLLM (GeoGemma)**: Trained on geospatial datasets to generate accurate GEE scripts.
- **LangChain Integration**: Enables AI-driven geospatial workflows.
- **Google Cloud Deployment**: Uses Vertex AI, Compute Engine, and Firebase.
- **Focus Areas**: Climate monitoring, agriculture analysis, and Earth observation democratization.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning**: Google Gemma, Vertex AI
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud (Compute Engine, Firebase, BigQuery)
- **Geospatial Tools**: Google Earth Engine, Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, PyTorch/TensorFlow

## Project Recognition
- **Winner**: NASTP Research Showcase
- **Featured at**: Google DevFest Islamabad
- **Supported by**: $10,000 Google Research Grant

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/geogemma.git
cd geogemma
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```python
from geogemma import GeoLLM
geo_model = GeoLLM()
response = geo_model.generate("Get precipitation data for California using CHIRPS")
print(response)
```
